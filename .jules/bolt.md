**Learning:** `memcmp` optimization in `btrie.c` was already present, despite initial scan. Always verify current code state against memory or hypothesis. Replacing simple arithmetic macros like `HEXVAL` with 256-byte tables might not yield performance benefits on modern CPUs due to cache pressure vs branch prediction efficiency. However, removing integer division in `ip4atos` yielded significant (~1.4x) speedup.
**Action:** Verify "obvious" optimizations are not already applied. Benchmark small lookups vs arithmetic before committing to table-based optimizations.
